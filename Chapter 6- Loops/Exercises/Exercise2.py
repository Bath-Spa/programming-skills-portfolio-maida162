# Exercise 2: Movie Tickets: 

"""A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age
of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12,
the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their
movie ticket."""
